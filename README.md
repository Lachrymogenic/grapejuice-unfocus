## RUN THE COMMANDS AND YOU ARE GOOD TO GO

Extremely simple window unfocus script for Grapejuice (https://gitlab.com/brinkervii/grapejuice/)

# What is Grapejuice?
Grapejuice is a Roblox + Wine management application that allows people to play roblox on Linux. It works almost flawlessly for me, except I have 1 small issue: Whenever I right click, the game takes control of my mouse and never lets go unless I alt-tab or unfocus and refocus the window.

# What is this script for?
This script creates a tkinter window when you right click and then immediately destroys it (if roblox is open), temporarily solving my issue. To use the script, simply execute it in python, then load up a Roblox game. Refrain from using it in Phantom Forces or any FPS game, as theres no way for me to detect if I've died and went back to the main menu.

If the script doesn't work, feel free to modify it.
